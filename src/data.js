Our goal was clear: to impart essential waste management skills and demonstrate the creative conversion of waste into art. This hands-on approach not only educates the students but also inspires them to take action. The outcome was remarkable as we witnessed a reduction in plastic waste within the school community. Through innovative workshops and interactive sessions, students learned how to repurpose waste materials, turning them into beautiful and functional pieces. ',

Moreover, our program was supported by over 20 passionate youth volunteers who played a pivotal role in engaging with the children, sharing knowledge, and facilitating the activities. Join us in celebrating this collaborative effort towards a cleaner, greener future! ',
